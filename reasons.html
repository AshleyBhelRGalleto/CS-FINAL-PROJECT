            <h2>Reasons for Inequality in Education</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Poverty and limited resources - Families living in poverty often struggle to afford educational essentials like uniforms, books, and transportation, which prevents children from attending school regularly or receiving quality education. This lack of resources can also result in overcrowded classrooms and underfunded schools, hindering overall learning. </li>
                <li>     </li>
                <li>Geographical disparities - Children living in remote or rural areas may face difficulties in accessing schools due to distance, poor transportation, or lack of nearby educational facilities. As a result, these students may have fewer opportunities for quality education compared to those in urban areas, leading to educational inequality.</li>
                <li>     </li>
                <li>Social and gender biases - In many parts of the world, certain social groups, such as girls or ethnic minorities, may face discrimination that limits their access to education. Cultural attitudes and traditional gender roles can prevent these groups from attending school or receiving the same educational opportunities as others, reinforcing cycles of inequality.</li>
                <li>     </li>
                <li>Lack of infrastructure and access to schools - Inadequate school facilities, such as poorly constructed classrooms, insufficient teaching materials, and a lack of basic amenities like clean water and electricity, create an environment where quality education cannot be effectively delivered. Additionally, schools in underserved areas may lack trained teachers, further limiting educational opportunities for children.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Reasons of Poor Education</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Poverty and Limited Resources: Children from low-income families often lack basic resources like books, computers, and internet access, preventing them from receiving an adequate education. </li>
                <li>     </li>
                <li> Geographical Disparities: Many children in rural areas have to travel long distances to attend school, or sometimes there are no schools nearby at all, which can hinder their ability to access education.</li>
                <li>     </li>
                <li> Lack of Infrastructure and Access to Schools: Poorly equipped schools with inadequate learning spaces, overcrowded classrooms, and a shortage of qualified teachers make it difficult for students to get the education they deserve.</li>
                <li>     </li>
                <li> Political Instability and Conflict: In regions affected by political instability, armed conflict, or natural disasters, education systems are often the first to collapse, leaving children without the opportunity for schooling. </li>
            </ul>
