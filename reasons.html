            <h2>Reasons for Inequality in Education</h2>
            <ul>
     <li>
            <strong>Poverty and limited resources</strong> - Families living in poverty often struggle to afford educational essentials like uniforms, books, and transportation, which prevents children from attending school regularly or receiving quality education. This lack of resources can also result in overcrowded classrooms and underfunded schools, hindering overall learning.
     </li>
     <li>
        <strong>Geographical disparities</strong> - Children living in remote or rural areas may face difficulties in accessing schools due to distance, poor transportation, or lack of nearby educational facilities. As a result, these students may have fewer opportunities for quality education compared to those in urban areas, leading to educational inequality.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Social and gender biases</strong> - In many parts of the world, certain social groups, such as girls or ethnic minorities, may face discrimination that limits their access to education. Cultural attitudes and traditional gender roles can prevent these groups from attending school or receiving the same educational opportunities as others, reinforcing cycles of inequality.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Lack of infrastructure and access to schools</strong> - Inadequate school facilities, such as poorly constructed classrooms, insufficient teaching materials, and a lack of basic amenities like clean water and electricity, create an environment where quality education cannot be effectively delivered. Additionally, schools in underserved areas may lack trained teachers, further limiting educational opportunities for children.

    <h2>Reasons of Poor Education</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Poverty and limited resources</strong>: Families in poverty often cannot afford essential educational resources such as books, internet access, or transportation. This lack of resources prevents children from accessing quality education and often results in overcrowded and underfunded schools.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Geographical disparities</strong>: Children in rural or remote areas may have to travel long distances to attend school or may not have schools nearby at all. This geographical divide means that children in these areas often have fewer educational opportunities than their urban counterparts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Social and gender biases</strong>: Discrimination based on gender, race, or social status can prevent marginalized groups, such as girls or minorities, from receiving an education. Cultural norms and biases can limit access to schooling and perpetuate systemic inequalities.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Lack of infrastructure and access to schools</strong>: Many schools, especially in underdeveloped areas, lack basic infrastructure like adequate classrooms, reliable transportation, and access to quality teachers. This makes it difficult for children to receive a proper education.
